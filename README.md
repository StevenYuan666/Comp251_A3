# Ford Fulkerson and Bellman Ford Algorithms
## For Fulkerson
We will implement the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to calculate the Maximum Flow of a di- rected weighted graph.

## Bellman Ford
We want to implement the Bellman-Ford algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph where edges can have negative weights.
